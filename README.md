- Save the graph as a hashed JSON file for later use.

### Solve Mode:
- Load a previously saved JSON file containing a graph design.
- View blank nodes as draggable options on the left side of the page.
- Drag and drop options to their correct positions on the graph.
- Receive a success notification ("Correct!") when all nodes are placed accurately.

## How to Use
### After designing and saving the tree graph
1. Load a saved JSON graph file.
2. Drag the blank node values (displayed on the left) to their correct positions in the graph.
3. Place all values correctly to see a success popup.
